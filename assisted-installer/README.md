# Assisted Installer Scripts

## Prerequisites

The following binaries need to be included in the system $PATH:

- curl
- jq
- python3

## Assisted Installer Steps for Bare Metal machines with Static IPs

1. Get offline token and save it to `~/rh-api-offline-token`
> [Red Hat API Tokens](https://access.redhat.com/management/api)

```bash
vim ~/rh-api-offline-token
```

2. Get OpenShift Pull Secret and save it to `~/ocp-pull-secret`
> [Install OpenShift on Bare Metal](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/metal/installer-provisioned)

```bash
vim ~/ocp-pull-secret
```

3. Ensure there is an SSH Public Key at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

4. Copy the cluster variables example file and modify as needed

```bash
cp example.cluster-vars.sh cluster-vars.sh
vim cluster-vars.sh
```

5. Run the bootstrap script to create the cluster, configure it, and download the ISO

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```

Sample expected output:

```
[kemo@raza assisted-installer]$ ./bootstrap.sh

6. Boot each machine with downloaded ISO

## Bootstrap Execution Overview

- Run Preflight tasks - ensure files and variables are set, create asset generation directory
- Authenticate to the Assisted Installer Service
- Query the Assisted Installer Service for the supported OCP Release Version
- Create a Cluster in the AI Svc if it does not already exist
- Produce NMState configuration file
- [Optional] Set core user password
- Configure the Discovery ISO
- Download the Discovery ISO

Generated assets can be found in `./.generated/${CLUSTER_NAME}.${CLUSTER_BASE_DNS}/`

## Add worker nodes to deployment
[Steps to add worker node](addworker.md)

## Destroy Cluster

A simple script exists to delete a created cluster from the Assisted Installer Service and from the local file system:

```bash
## Requires a set cluster-vars.sh, looks for CLUSTER_ID in the `./.generated/${CLUSTER_NAME}.${CLUSTER_BASE_DNS}/` directory
./destroy.sh
```
